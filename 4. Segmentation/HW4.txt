Your goal is to perform semi-automatic binary segmentation based on SLIC superpixels and graph-cuts:

    Given an image and sparse markings for foreground and background
    Calculate SLIC over image
    Calculate color histograms for all superpixels
    Calculate color histograms for FG and BG
    Construct a graph that takes into account superpixel-to-superpixel interaction (smoothness term), as well as superpixel-FG/BG interaction (match term)
    Run a graph-cut algorithm to get the final segmentation
