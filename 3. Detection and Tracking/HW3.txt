Your goal is to:

    Detect the face in the first frame of the movie: Using pre-trained Viola-Jones detector

    Track the face throughout the movie using:

        CAMShift

        Particle Filter

        Face detector + Kalman Filter (always run the kf.predict(), and run kf.correct() when you get a new face detection)
