Your goal is to reconstruct a scene from multiple structured light scannings of it.

    Calibrate projector with the “easy” method

        Use ray-plane intersection

        Get 2D-3D correspondence and use stereo calibration
        We did this work for you...

    Get the binary code for each pixel - this you should do, but it's super easy

    Correlate code with (x,y) position - we provide a "codebook" from binary code -> (x,y)

    With 2D-2D correspondence

        Perform stereo triangulation (existing function) to get a depth map
        You do this too
